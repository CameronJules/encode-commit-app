# ____ Productivity

A gamified productivity app that turns to-dos into an enjoyable and sustainable experience. Think *Duolingo for productivity*.

Built during the Encode Club **Commit to Change** hackathon, the app rewards consistency, breaks goals into manageable tasks, and makes staying productive feel engaging rather than overwhelming.

This repository contains the **frontend** codebase.
The **backend** is available here:
[https://github.com/CameronJules/encode-commit-app-backend](https://github.com/CameronJules/encode-commit-app-backend)

> The app name has been intentionally omitted to reduce searchability ahead of its App Store release.

# Buddies
